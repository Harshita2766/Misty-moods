# Misty Moods - Weather Forecasting ML Model

## Project Overview
**Misty Moods** is an AI-driven weather forecasting model designed to predict weather conditions based on historical data and real-time updates. The project integrates machine learning with a dynamic dashboard, providing accurate and reliable weather predictions. It allows users to stay informed about the weather in their area, which is crucial for making day-to-day decisions, planning outdoor activities, or preparing for extreme weather conditions.

### Why It Matters:
- **Accurate Predictions**: The model utilizes multiple weather parameters to ensure precise and localized forecasts.
- **Real-Time Data**: It pulls real-time data for continuous accuracy and updates.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: The weather data is presented on an intuitive dashboard for easy access, helping users quickly understand the forecast.
- **Empowering Decision-Making**: Accurate weather information helps users plan better for weather-sensitive activities such as travel, sports, events, or daily routines.

## Key Features & Technologies

### **Key Features**:
- **Weather Forecasting**: The ML model predicts weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., for future days.
- **Data Updates**: Automated real-time updates of weather data from APIs to ensure predictions stay relevant.
- **Supaboard Dashboard**: A visually appealing and interactive dashboard displaying the weather forecast in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Weather Parameters**: Incorporates 23 essential weather parameters (such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, humidity, etc.) to provide more accurate forecasts.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Python libraries such as `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` for model training and prediction.
- **Supaboard**: A tool for creating interactive dashboards to visualize weather data.
- **APIs**: For fetching real-time weather data from external sources (like OpenWeatherMap or Weather API).
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing, model development, and API interaction.
- **Pandas, Numpy**: For data processing and manipulation.
